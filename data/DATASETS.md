# Data — what goes where

This project has three kinds of data, each in its own folder under `data/`. None of
it is committed to git (see `.gitignore`) — you add it locally once.

## 1. `data/jobs/` — the job corpus (you download this)

The job postings you embed into FAISS for semantic search. Download once from Kaggle.

| Dataset | Kaggle slug (`owner/name`) | What you get |
|---------|----------------------------|--------------|
| **Jobs on Naukri.com** (~22k Indian jobs) | `PromptCloudHQ/jobs-on-naukricom` | `naukri_com-job_sample.csv` |

Columns you use for the embedded text: `jobtitle`, `skills`, `jobdescription`
(combined into one string per job). The file also has `company`,
`joblocation_address`, `experience`, `payrate`, etc. — keep them to show alongside a
match, ignore the rest.

> Any job dataset with a title + skills + description works. LinkedIn job postings
> (`arshkon/linkedin-job-postings`) is a good larger alternative if you want more
> variety.

### How to download

**Option A — one script (easiest):**
```
pip install kagglehub
python download_data.py
```
The first run asks for your Kaggle credentials (username + API key from
Kaggle → Settings → **API** → **Create New Token**). It places the CSV in
`data/jobs/`.

**Option B — Kaggle website (no code):** create a free account at kaggle.com, search
"jobs on naukri", **Download**, unzip, and move the CSV into `data/jobs/`.

**Option C — Kaggle API:**
```
pip install kaggle
# after saving kaggle.json to ~/.kaggle/ (Windows: C:\Users\<you>\.kaggle\)
kaggle datasets download -d PromptCloudHQ/jobs-on-naukricom -p data/jobs --unzip
```

The filename is already wired up in `src/config.py` (`JOBS_CSV`). Only edit that if
your downloaded filename differs.

## 2. `data/resumes/` — sample resumes (you add these)

A few PDF or DOCX resumes to test the parser and the job search. Use your own resume,
your teammates', or a handful from the Kaggle resume dataset
(`jillanisofttech/updated-resume-dataset`) exported to PDF. Two or three are enough
to build with.

## 3. `data/career_notes/` — the mentor's knowledge base (starter notes provided)

The documents the AI Career Mentor retrieves from (RAG). Two starter notes ship with
the project:

```
data/career_notes/
├── data_analyst_roadmap.md
└── resume_writing_tips.md
```

Add more as markdown or text files — role guides, skill roadmaps, interview tips.
The more (relevant) notes you add, the more questions the mentor can answer from
grounded sources. The mentor must answer **from these notes**, not from open-ended
generation — that grounding is part of the grade.
